This is a Foursquare Project Sample

A few enhancements to keep in mind:
* Better data persistance.
* Use SVGs for the favorite/unfavorite icons and apply colors instead.
* Add unit testing.
* Add an empty view in cases: no query requested by user OR no search results for user's requested query.
* Add an error view to handle errors from BE.
* Add a loading dialog/view when a query is being performed.
* Add an error dialog in case device can't connect to internet.
* Integrate category icons into Google Map results (pins).

Observations / Notes:
* Note that URL per venue are not comming back from API, so default URL is "google.com" for now.
